# Mortar Language Guide

Welcome to the official documentation for Mortar, a Domain Specific Language (DSL) designed for game dialogue and text event systems.

## What is Mortar?

Mortar is a modern dialogue scripting language that emphasizes **strict separation between text content and event logic**. Unlike other dialogue systems, Mortar ensures that your narrative content remains clean and unpolluted by technical markup, while still providing powerful event-driven features.

## Key Features

- **Content Separation**: Clean separation between narrative text and system events
- **Clear Semantics**: Rust-style syntax that's intuitive and readable  
- **Program Friendly**: Compiles to JSON for easy integration
- **Static Typing**: Compile-time type checking for reliability
- **Event-Driven**: Precise event timing based on character indices

## Who Should Use Mortar?

Mortar is perfect for:

- 🎮 **Game Developers** building dialogue systems for RPGs, visual novels, or adventure games
- 📚 **Interactive Fiction Authors** creating branching narratives
- 🎬 **Multimedia Creators** synchronizing text with audio, animations, or visual effects
- 🤖 **Chat Bot Developers** designing structured conversation flows
